Welcome to the **AI Sales Development Representative** repository! This project aims to enhance sales processes through advanced AI tools. We have developed an end-to-end system that includes an AI prospect researcher, AI email generator, and AI follow-up and meeting scheduler. Our system boosts engagement by 35%. Additionally, we have created an AI meeting assistant that transcribes conversations and extracts action items, complete with a searchable knowledge base.
